  As a student who loves mathematics and is interested in teaching, I started to open the gates of my dreams by studying at the Department of Mathematics Education at Universitas Sebelas Maret. 
<br><br>
  I like teaching, especially teaching math. I'm a fast learner and a highly enthusiastic person. Finding new experiences and skills is my way to improve myself. 
<br><br>
  I also have an interest in the technology and design field. I'm starting to study in that field.
